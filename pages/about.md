## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

The template repository features a multitude of objects from founder Frank B. Robinson and staff from the Psychiana New Thought religious movement in the 1930s and '40s, including many photographs of people and locations, correspondence, and other texts.
